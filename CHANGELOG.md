# Changelog

All notable changes to SystemInfo are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Linux packaging: AppImage and .deb builds via a new "Build Linux Installer" GitHub Actions workflow, producing installers alongside the existing Windows one.
- `start-all.sh` now supports a `SYSTEMINFO_LOG_DIR` environment override (defaults to the old behavior when unset) — required so logging works inside an AppImage's read-only runtime filesystem.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed a PowerShell variable/colon parsing error in `start-all.ps1` (`Fail-WithLog`: `"$logfile:"` was being misread as a scope qualifier) that caused the packaged Windows application to crash immediately after a successful install.

### Known Issues


## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-20

- Windows test release to verify whether the packaged application works correctly on Windows.
- This release is primarily intended for testing the Windows installer and runtime behavior.
